Title: The Starbucks Alternative
Tags: forty-eight



I'm all about continual self improvement. One of the ways I have tried to
become a better me has been by waking up as early as possible in order to read
for at least one hour per day. **[Brian
Tracy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pz03hNEVTE)** introduced me to this
idea and I promise you that it truly makes the start to your day a whole lot
better.



This took me some time to get used to, but once I realized how good I felt
every morning, I stopped pressing snooze and began to get out of bed almost
immediately.







**The Starbucks Alternative:**



Reading for an hour or more at the start of the day gives you clarity and
mental alertness from the minute you leave your house to the second you fall
asleep - it's simply amazing. I haven't had a coffee in a while (although I
will never fork over my tea addiction) all thanks to this life hack. So in a
way, reading each morning will save you some money and keep your teeth white,
all while you enrich your mind.







**Knowledge Booster:**



Just like a snowball, the small bits of reading each day accumulate to large
chunks of knowledge. So preferably read something that you've always aspired
to become more proficient in. Personally, I'll read for an hour or more about
investing, and I'm sure that eventually I'll be able to make more intelligent
investment decisions.







So give it a shot, you'll never know until you try it.
