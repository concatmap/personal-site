Title: And We're Off to the Races!

Today marks day one of the [Self Development
Challenge](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/self-development-challenge-the-plan/) and
I've got to say how exciting it feels once again to start yet another
interesting course. There are considerable differences between [David
Malan's](http://cs.harvard.edu/malan/) (Harvard's CS50 Professor) and [Patrick
Winston's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Winston) (MIT's Artificial
Intelligence Professor) teaching styles, but they are both highly inspiring
people.

Although substantially more mathematical than
[CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-
cs50x), MIT's [Introduction to Artificial
Intelligence](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-
science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/index.htm) will not only
strengthen my mathematical skills but provide me with a greater understanding
of the way decisions are made, and serve to strengthen my skills as an
Economics Major.

After this course I will know how to make simple representations of the human
mind with the help of [Python](https://www.python.org/about/). I'll try to
post with greater detail as I progress throughout the term.

Here is the first lecture to the Artificial Intelligence course.
