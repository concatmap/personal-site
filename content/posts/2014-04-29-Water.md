Title: Be Water, My Friend
Tags: forty-eight

As I write this, I'm wrapping up a refreshing stair climb situated within a
tree-covered ravine. The 42 wooden steps that I lapped on blend perfectly with
the surrounding forestry, and down below sits a calm stream that runs beyond
eyesight. From start to finish, I was fully aware of the stream's presence but
with headphones attached and music blaring, I did not fully encompass its
voice. Only after my run did I turn my music off and began to listen. I then
began to recall Bruce Lee's infamous quote:

> Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless -- like water. Now you put water
into a cup, it becomes the cup, you put water into a bottle, it becomes the
bottle, you put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or
it can crash. Be water, my friend.

The more I listened, the more I contemplated.

Water can be anything it wants: It can soothe you. It can harm you. It can
save you.

Water can be cold, warm, solid, lightweight, and heavy.

Water has seen, felt, sensed, and travelled beyond the capacity of any one
human being.

Yet it is what you and I are mostly composed of.
