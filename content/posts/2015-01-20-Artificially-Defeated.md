Title: Artificially Defeated
Tags: posts

After two grueling days of suffering, I finally finished the [first problem
set](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-
science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-
fall-2010/assignments/MIT6_034F10_lab0.pdf) of [MIT's AI
course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-
science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/index.htm) and all I can say
is WOW is it ever harder than [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-
computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) but just as rewarding!

I want to show my work in some way but I haven't really thought about the best
way to do so. I may create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account even though
I have no idea how [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29)
actually works just to introduce myself to another useful programming tool...
that or I could just slap the code on another page here. Not much of a concern
for now.
