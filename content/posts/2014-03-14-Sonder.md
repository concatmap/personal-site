Although not [yet] recognized as a legitimate word within dictionaries, it has
very real connotations. I'm sure you've experienced this in your life before;
you're walking down the street when, for a brief second, you realize that you
are just one life amongst billions of people with their own concerns.
Suddenly, your problems seem minuscule relative to what everyone else might be
going through. The fact that you're reading this means that you are rich
beyond belief (we just choose to forget that there are people living on
pennies a day because materialism keeps us from settling with what we have).



It's extremely humbling to think about this concept, and a rather sad reality
that we don't consider this enough when making decisions. Add [the mysticism
of a life prior to, and after, the current one](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/the-
egg.html "The Egg"), and a sense of guilt emerges when we realize how self-
interested everyone is.



Then there's the notion that those who seem inconceivably distant to us are
only ["6 degrees"
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation)away. Suddenly,
quarrels with those perceived as enemies becomes one of life's logical
dilemmas. We are all interconnected in some way, which eliminates any purpose
for war other than greedy intentions and ulterior motives. It's a nasty thing
what money can do to those who initially begin with well-meaning intentions.
But I digress from the main point in this post:

> You're just a walk-on part in everyone else's play.
