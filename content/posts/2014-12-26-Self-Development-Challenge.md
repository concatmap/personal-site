Title: Self Development Challenge
Tags: posts

I have been quite interested in the pursuit of self-education for some time
now.



Reading about self-taught entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, Emerson Spartz and
Scott Young (in the video below) has made me curious to see how capable I am
at teaching myself something completely out of my realm.

With that said, I've placed some really exciting goals for the next few
months. I will seek to become:



  * A proficient programmer
  * Knowledgeable in Artificial Intelligence
  * Capable of creating my own software product

  







I'll begin blogging about my experiences once I embark on this journey.



Happy Holidays :)
