Title: Chilling Out
Tags: posts

I find it very difficult to reject the opportunity to learn something new, or
to go out of my comfort zone to expand my horizons. the undertaking of more
tasks, however, impedes the progression of all goals currently in place.

I came across perfectly lines out what I mean by this. Here's a quote from the
post:

> About a month before you planned to return to work you realize that you
haven't achieved any of the things you set out to do, you wasted thousands of
dollars that you could have spent on a fancy holiday or a new car, and the
only thing you have to look forward to now is several more years of mind
numbing work as you edge closer and closer towards your grave.

I think the above perfectly lines out my greatest fear - not achieving what I
set out to do. And it seems very real when I watch my self uncontrollably take
on more than I can handle, which leads me to the brink of mental overload.
What I'm slowly realizing is that it's better to be the master of one or two
things [rather than being a jack of all
trades](http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/21fu6c/i_want_to_feel_like_a_master_of_one_skillhobby/cgcrvsp),
but master of none.



Slowing down, reflecting on current goals, and then continuing on the path to
those goals is the key. Doing too much will [diminish your
capabilities](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/diminishing-marginal-returns-to-
life.html "Diminishing Marginal Returns To Life") to the point of zero
accomplishment.
