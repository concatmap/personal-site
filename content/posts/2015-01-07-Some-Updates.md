Title: Some Updates

## Artificial Intelligence

Prior to beginning the [first assignment](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses
/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-
fall-2010/assignments/MIT6_034F10_lab0.pdf) of MIT's Artificial Intelligence
course, I had to decide which
[IDE](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/integrated-
development-environment) to choose from. After some [light
reading](http://pedrokroger.net/choosing-best-python-ide/), I was quite
tempted to download [WingWare](http://www.wingware.com/) as it has some
features that I really like such as setting breakpoints and walking line by
line through code. But seeing as I have already taken an introductory
programming class using [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/), I decided I rather
just stay with my current IDE and just learn how to use Eclipse efficiently.



## Web Development / Programming Improvements

Through Udemy's Web Development Course, I have been Exposed to HTML, CSS,
Javascript, jQuery, and now [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I'm
about 70% done the course already - what remains now are some lessons on
server-side tools and frameworks such as WordPress, Mobile-First websites,
PHP, MySQL, and finally some lessons on APIs.

As I proceed with the Artificial Intelligence course I'll also use resources
such as [DiveIntoPython](http://www.diveintopython.net/) and
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) to overcome my inevitable
struggles.



## Tech Product Development

Today marks my first day of class at University of Waterloo's business
development course. Hopefully by the end of the next four months I'll have a
solid understanding of the requirements needed to launch a tech product
successfully.

Cheers.
