Title: Renovations 2.0
Tags: posts

In an effort to continue learning more about technology and keep my skills
sharp (and save some moneyz), I'm going to migrate from
[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) to [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/) / [GitHub
Pages](//pages.github.com/).



This move also goes in tandem with my effort to become good with
[Git](https://www.git-scm.com/) / [GitHub](//github.com/) so that I may have a
public portfolio of my work down the road.



I just started playing around with [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/) a few days ago
and it seems simple enough to pick up after a bit of reading. Here's what the
site looks like [right now](https://gdelgado14.github.io/) (this is the
default bootstrap Jekyll deployment hosted via GitHub Pages).



Jekyll has a library that allows me to easily import Wordpress data directly
into my blog but I feel like that's a learning opportunity foregone.
Thankfully I found out about [Scrapy](//scrapy.org/); a Python web scraper.
Hopefully I'll have some time to create a custom scraper that walks through
the blog and have a nice clean JSON export feed that I can then convert to
markdown. This already sounds overly ambitious ... but hey, why not shoot for
the moon, right?
