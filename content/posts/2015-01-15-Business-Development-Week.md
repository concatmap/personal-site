Title: Business Development Week
Tags: posts

Besides the fact that I'm running on no sleep due to a family wedding, this
whole week was spent developing my business idea.

I don't want to mention it yet, but I do have to pitch it to my class next
week.

For those of you interested in starting your own businesses, these are the
tools we were given to create rough ideas for our businesses.

Both the [Business Model Generation & Value Proposition
Design](https://strategyzer.com/books) books will teach you the fundamentals
to create [LEAN](http://theleanstartup.com/) businesses.

Another resource that I'm using right now is [this
book](http://leanentrepreneur.co/).

On the technical side, like I've said before, I'm learning web development
through Udemy's [Complete Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/complete-
web-developer-course). But my skills will only take me so far, and I hope I
can meet a technical co-founder at University of Waterloo. So the advice here
is; meet those that can help you create your product!

Since I no longer foresee any weddings or significant disturbances for the
next four months, you will start to see more consistency in my blog posts (I'm
considering a weekly post on Sundays) as well as a greater amount of work
done. I'm behind on [MIT's AI course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-
engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-
fall-2010/index.htm) but I should get a few weeks ahead starting next week.

Cheers.
