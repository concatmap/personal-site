I stumbled onto this image a few days ago and it reminded me a whole lot of
[Plato's Allegory of the
Cave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave).



I strongly encourage you to learn the morals of the allegory, for it provides
a generalization of society's structure.



Another representation of society's repercussions is exemplified within
[Aldous Huxley's Brave New World](http://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-World-
Aldous-Huxley/dp/0060850523).



These two ideals, along with the image that inspired me to write this post,
detail how a lot of what we do is essentially a distraction that keeps us
unaware of what's truly occurring around us. We are constantly bombarded with
propaganda, and more information than we need in order to keep us away from
what truly matters.



Another problem that occurs is that we inherently avert any type of deep
contemplation, and instead seek quick gratification and satisfaction. The
temptations that surround us every minute only enforce these innate habits
that prohibit most of civilization to think critically of important events.



Thus, as Plato depicts, the majority of us are left looking at what we
perceive as reality, not ever realizing that we have been living [beneath the
real world](//marlaongtao.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/plato-cave.jpg) our
entire lives.
