Title: To Do Make List Making a Habit
Tags: posts

With the sheer amount of things running around in my head I simply had to
figure out a way to organize, categorize and prioritize.

Of course there are apps, web applications, mentors, and a myriad of other
ways to relief stress and increase productivity when it comes to managing
multiple tasks.

But as [Occam](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html) would
say, the simplest method is often the most efficient.

That is why I have begun writing just about everything down in actionable
ways. I can't be the only one here whose mind begins to race at the seemingly
insurmountable amount of things required to be done in order to achieve a
certain goal, and more so if the goal is a rather lofty one.

It is imperative that items be actionable and not vague. Writing down (as I
have before) "Python CodeCademy" is useless and can't even be verified for
completion. A more efficient item on a to do list would go along the lines of,
"Finish Intro To Classes Module". Then I can check - Did I finish this module?
Why or Why Not? Should I get more granular? ... and so on.

There's something special about writing things as well. I can't quite put my
finger on it (no pun intended), but when pen meets paper my concerns seem to
vanish as my ideas take on simpler form.

Once all is jotted down, I categorize and look at what needs to be done and
what is fluff.

Combined with my calendar, where I've made it a habit to include all my
deadlines, meetings, and other tasks, I can prioritize my list items based on
urgency and importance.

And when something doesn't get finished. It simply gets moved onto the
following day's To Do list, which is compiled the night before.

Voila, productivity increased.
