Title: My Year So Far [ In Haiku ]
Tags: forty-eight

I didn't want to spend too much time on my blog today so I felt like being as
creative as possible with the least amount of effort.



I recently moved away on an internship, which has already provided me with
some memorable events. Here are some of them in haiku:





**Move-in Day**

Arguments in car

Why are you buying Dinar

No adults in sight



**The Night Before The First Day At Work**

Indian roommate

Phone calls overseas all night

The walls are too thin



**New Year's Eve**

In downtown T.O.

What the hell happened last night

I rather recall



**Amazed At Roommate's Ninja Skills**

One month living here

Still have not met a roommate

I know you are there



**Waking Up Early To Read**

No more pressing snooze

Feels like I just chugged coffee

**Getting Settled In At Work**

Very awesome group

learning how to program things

Drinking too much tea



**Becoming Good Friends With My Indian Roommate**

Indian boy cooks

Colleagues envy my good lunch

Free chef services
