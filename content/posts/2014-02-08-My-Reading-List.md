Title: My Reading List
Tags: books

Like previously mentioned, [I'm all about continual self
improvement](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/the-starbucks-alternative.html "The
Starbucks Alternative"). But much like the show "Hoarders", I too have a
problem with letting things go. In my case, however, it's information. The
second I see a useful link, newsletter, or potential tap for knowledge I
immediately note it down. For links, I save them into my reading list.
Newsletters, I click on the subscribe button. But books, that's where the real
hoarding happens. I always hear, or read about recommendations and invariably
write them down. This tendency of mine has somewhat hindered my ability to
stay focused on one task. I figured, then, that at least someone out there may
use my ever expanding book list to better use.



Here are the current books I have in either digital or physical form that I
have yet to read:

  * [Brave New World - Aldous Huxley](http://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-World-Aldous-Huxley/dp/0060850523)
  * [Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman](http://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)
  * [Infinite Jest - David Foster](http://www.amazon.ca/Infinite-Jest-David-Foster-Wallace/dp/0316066524)
  * [Empire of Debt - Bill Bonner & Addison Wiggin](http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Empire-Debt-Financial/dp/B00BRB7UWW)
  * [Liar's Poker - Michael Lewis](http://www.amazon.ca/Liars-Poker-Michael-Lewis/dp/039333869X)
  * [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator - Edwin Lefevre](http://www.amazon.com/Reminiscences-Stock-Operator-Edwin-Lefevre/dp/1479161047/ref=tmm_pap_title_0)
  * [The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty - Dan Ariely](http://www.amazon.ca/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone-Especially/dp/0062183613)
  * [Valuation - McKinsey & Company](http://www.amazon.ca/Valuation-Measuring-Managing-Companies-University/dp/0470424702)

I did not bother showing the inordinate amount of finanicial academic research
papers or other quantitative financial literature.



Here is the list of books I hope to some day read. I have split the list
between finance and non finance books.

Hopefully this list gives you something to read, because I doubt this backlog
will be cleared by me any time soon. As previously mentioned, I have another
list of more technical books and journal articles. If you wish to attain this
list, please contact me.
